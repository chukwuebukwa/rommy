After\ndoing this for a few weeks I went to conduct my business as usual\u2026\nfeeling great. I went to press and my trap pulled on me and I was\nout of the gym for a few weeks as a result. When we injure\nourselves, we tend to get frustrated which is normal. But instead of\nthinking of it as a setback\u2026 think of it as your body\u2019s feedback to\nreport to you that there are things to fix.\nI swear to you, every time I thought of it in this way\u2026I\u2019d go on to fix\nthe problem (injury) & my muscles and strength would BLOW past\nmy previous markers. Felt like magic and when I realized the\nsignificance of these \u201cannoying little muscles\u201d I began to actually\nlook forward to it.\nBecause it requires such little effort to get these muscles up to\nspeed.
