## Session 1: Exercise Video Audit & Fixes

### Problem
Many exercises had wrong, broken, or missing YouTube video URLs. Some exercises were showing completely unrelated videos (e.g., "Weighted Pull Ups" had a Front Squats video).

### Audit Script Created
`prisma/scripts/audit-exercise-videos.ts`
- Parses all guide CSV files from `full-exports/`
- Fetches exercises from database
- Checks video URLs via YouTube oEmbed API
- Fuzzy matches exercise names to find correct videos
- Flags: broken (deleted/private), missing (no URL), wrong (title mismatch)

Usage:
```bash
bun run prisma/scripts/audit-exercise-videos.ts --check-videos
```

### Fix Script Created
`prisma/scripts/fix-exercise-videos.ts`
- 47 curated video fixes based on audit results
- Categories: BROKEN (13), MISSING (9), WRONG (25)
- Supports `--dry-run` flag

### Results
- Before: 187 OK exercises
- After: 227 OK exercises (+40 fixed)
- Remaining missing (no video in guides): 3
  - Hip Abduction Machine
  - Hip Adduction Machine
  - Reverse Grip Pushdowns

## Session 2: Exercise Video Manager UI

Built admin UI at `/admin/exercise-videos` for ongoing video management.

### Features
- Stats dashboard (total, has video, missing, needs review)
- Search by exercise name or ID
- Filter buttons: All | Has Video | Missing | Needs Review
- Thumbnail grid (lazy-loaded, not iframes)
- Click to open ExerciseDrawer with full details
- Inline URL editing with save/cancel

### Review Mode
- Full-screen review interface
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Progress bar
- Large video player (iframe)
- "Mark Done" checkmark button
- Auto-advance on mark done
- Progress persisted to localStorage

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/admin/exercise-videos/page.tsx` | Main UI with review mode |
| `app/api/exercises/route.ts` | GET all exercises |
| `app/api/exercises/[id]/route.ts` | GET single exercise (added) |
| `app/api/exercises/[id]/video/route.ts` | PATCH video URL |

### Technical Notes
- Uses YouTube thumbnail images instead of iframes for performance
- `NEEDS_REVIEW_IDS` array contains 34 flagged exercise IDs from audit
- localStorage key: `reviewed-exercises`
