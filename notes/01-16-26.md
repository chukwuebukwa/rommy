## Session 1: Exercise Video Audit & Fixes

### Problem
Many exercises had wrong, broken, or missing YouTube video URLs. Some exercises were showing completely unrelated videos (e.g., "Weighted Pull Ups" had a Front Squats video).

### Audit Script Created
`prisma/scripts/audit-exercise-videos.ts`
- Parses all guide CSV files from `full-exports/`
- Fetches exercises from database
- Checks video URLs via YouTube oEmbed API
- Fuzzy matches exercise names to find correct videos
- Flags: broken (deleted/private), missing (no URL), wrong (title mismatch)

Usage:
```bash
bun run prisma/scripts/audit-exercise-videos.ts --check-videos
```

### Fix Script Created
`prisma/scripts/fix-exercise-videos.ts`
- 47 curated video fixes based on audit results
- Categories: BROKEN (13), MISSING (9), WRONG (25)
- Supports `--dry-run` flag

### Results
- Before: 187 OK exercises
- After: 227 OK exercises (+40 fixed)
- Remaining missing (no video in guides): 3
  - Hip Abduction Machine
  - Hip Adduction Machine
  - Reverse Grip Pushdowns

## Session 2: Exercise Video Manager UI

Built admin UI at `/admin/exercise-videos` for ongoing video management.

### Features
- Stats dashboard (total, has video, missing, needs review)
- Search by exercise name or ID
- Filter buttons: All | Has Video | Missing | Needs Review
- Thumbnail grid (lazy-loaded, not iframes)
- Click to open ExerciseDrawer with full details
- Inline URL editing with save/cancel

### Review Mode
- Full-screen review interface
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
- Progress bar
- Large video player (iframe)
- "Mark Done" checkmark button
- Auto-advance on mark done
- Progress persisted to localStorage

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/admin/exercise-videos/page.tsx` | Main UI with review mode |
| `app/api/exercises/route.ts` | GET all exercises |
| `app/api/exercises/[id]/route.ts` | GET single exercise (added) |
| `app/api/exercises/[id]/video/route.ts` | PATCH video URL |

### Technical Notes
- Uses YouTube thumbnail images instead of iframes for performance
- `NEEDS_REVIEW_IDS` array contains 34 flagged exercise IDs from audit
- localStorage key: `reviewed-exercises`

## Session 3: Export Script Fixes

### Problem
1. Latest database export (`db-export-2025-12-21.json`) was stale - missing 47 video fixes and 27 Section parent relationships (subpage feature)
2. Import script didn't handle Section `parentId` hierarchy - would fail if child section imported before parent

### Fix: Two-Pass Section Import
Updated `prisma/import-db.ts` to match the AnatomyNode pattern:
```typescript
// First pass: create sections WITHOUT parentId
for (const section of data.sections) {
  const { parentId, ...sectionWithoutParent } = section;
  await prisma.section.create({ data: sectionWithoutParent });
}

// Second pass: update parentId relationships
for (const section of data.sections) {
  if (section.parentId) {
    await prisma.section.update({
      where: { id: section.id },
      data: { parentId: section.parentId }
    });
  }
}
```

### New Export Created
`prisma/exports/db-export-2026-01-16.json`
- 230 exercises (227 with videoUrl)
- 80 sections (27 with parentId)
- 658 KB

## Session 4: Gym-Friendly Workout Program UX

### Problem
The "Sniper's Arm Day" program page was hard to use at the gym:
- Raw markdown with YouTube links (not clickable to see videos)
- Not using the structured `Workout` → `WorkoutBlock` → `Exercise` data
- Rep schemes buried in paragraphs
- Supersets not visually grouped

### Solution
New components that render workout programs in a scannable, gym-friendly format.

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `components/WorkoutBlockCard.tsx` | Renders a single workout block with exercises |
| `components/WorkoutProgramView.tsx` | Full program view with collapsible intro |
| `app/api/workouts/by-guide/[guideId]/route.ts` | API to fetch workout by guide region |

### Files Modified
| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `components/GuidePaginatedView.tsx` | Detects `kind: "program"` sections, fetches workout data, renders WorkoutProgramView |

### WorkoutBlockCard Features
- Dark header with block number and title
- Scheme badge (Drop Set, Superset, Straight Sets)
- Amber scheme description box
- **Superset grouping**: Set A (compound) → "THEN" arrow → Set B (isolation)
- Exercise cards with:
  - Name + video indicator (blue dot)
  - Type badge (compound/isolation)
  - Anatomy targets
  - Click to open ExerciseDrawer with video

### WorkoutProgramView Features
- Collapsible intro (starts collapsed) - "Show intro from Uncle Rommy"
- Full-width workout blocks
- Blocks sorted by label number (1-8)

### Technical Notes
- Blocks ordered by parsing number from label: `parseInt(label.match(/^(\d+)/)?.[1])`
- Supersets detected by `schemeStyle === "superset"` and grouping by `exercise.type`
- Rep ranges parsed from schemeDesc: `/(\d+[-–]\d+)\s*reps/gi`
- Workout fetched via `primaryRegionId` matching guide ID (arms → snipers_arm_day)
